# GPA Calculator for WCSD

Waukee Community School District has a different way of calculating GPA than other districts, so here is a calculator to see your GPA since a normal GPA calculator wouldn't work

## How to run 

- Make sure you have python installed
- Save the file as GPACalculator.py
- In terminal/command prompt, run "python GPACalculator.py
- You can also copy the code and put it into an online python compiler (https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler) or an IDE

## Warnings

This calculator bases it off of percentage, not the letter grade. If your teacher decided to round/ change the letter grade of the percent, like making 97.8% an A+, make sure to substitute that percent with the actual letter grade's percent.
